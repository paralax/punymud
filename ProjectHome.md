A port of the 2.0.0 version of the [TeensyMUD framework](http://sourcery.dyndns.org/wiki.cgi?TeensyMud) by John Lambert to Python. Surprisingly full featured.

Requires PyYAML for persistent storage.

Features:
  * multiple concurrent players
  * objects, rooms, everything you would expect in a MUD
  * very easy to use
