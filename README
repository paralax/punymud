PunyMUD Server
v 1.0.0

INTRODUCTION
PunyMUD is a very simple mud server written in Python. It uses threading to
handle multiple concurrent connections and YAML as a backend data store.

This server was originally based on the TeensyMUD 2.0.0 codebase by John
Lambert (the original was written in Ruby). This version was written to
see if it could be done in Python.

Does PunyMUD have a future? Maybe ... you decide!
